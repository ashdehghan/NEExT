# NEExT: Network Embedding Experimentation Toolkit

NEExT is a powerful Python framework for graph analysis, embedding computation, and machine learning on graph-structured data. It provides a unified interface for working with different graph backends (NetworkX and iGraph), computing node features, generating graph embeddings, and training machine learning models.

### Custom Node Feature Functions

NEExT allows you to define and compute your own custom node feature functions alongside the built-in ones. This provides great flexibility for experimenting with novel graph metrics.

**Defining a Custom Feature Function:**

Your custom feature function must adhere to the following structure:

1.  **Input**: It must accept a single argument, which will be a `graph` object. This object provides access to the graph's structure (nodes, edges) and properties (e.g., `graph.nodes`, `graph.graph_id`, `graph.G` which is the underlying NetworkX or iGraph object).
2.  **Output**: It must return a `pandas.DataFrame` with the following specific columns in order:
    *   `"node_id"`: Identifiers for the nodes for which features are computed.
    *   `"graph_id"`: The identifier of the graph to which these nodes belong.
    *   One or more feature columns: These columns should contain the computed feature values. The naming convention for these columns should ideally follow the pattern `your_feature_name_0`, `your_feature_name_1`, etc., if your feature has multiple components or is expanded over hops (though a single feature column like `your_feature_name` is also acceptable).

**Example:**

Here's how you can define a simple custom feature function and use it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# 1. Define your custom feature function
# This function must be defined at the top level of your script/module
# if you plan to use multiprocessing (n_jobs != 1).
def my_node_degree_squared(graph):
    nodes = list(graph.nodes) # or range(graph.G.vcount()) for igraph if nodes are 0-indexed
    graph_id = graph.graph_id
    
    if hasattr(graph.G, 'degree'): # Handles both NetworkX and iGraph
        if isinstance(graph.G, nx.Graph): # NetworkX
            degrees = [graph.G.degree(n) for n in nodes]
        else: # iGraph
            degrees = graph.G.degree(nodes)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Graph object does not have a degree method.")
        
    degree_squared_values = [d**2 for d in degrees]
    
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'node_id': nodes,
        'graph_id': graph_id,
        'degree_sq_0': degree_squared_values
    })
    # Ensure the correct column order
    return df[['node_id', 'graph_id', 'degree_sq_0']]

# 2. Prepare the list of custom feature methods
my_feature_methods = [
    {"feature_name": "my_degree_squared", "feature_function": my_node_degree_squared}
]

# 3. Pass it to compute_node_features
# Initialize NEExT and load your graph_collection as shown in the Quick Start
# nxt = NEExT()
# graph_collection = nxt.read_from_csv(...)

features = nxt.compute_node_features(
    graph_collection=graph_collection,
    feature_list=["page_rank", "my_degree_squared"], # Include your custom feature name
    feature_vector_length=3, # Applies to built-in features that use it
    my_feature_methods=my_feature_methods
)

print(features.features_df.head())
```

When you include `"my_degree_squared"` in the `feature_list` and provide `my_feature_methods`, NEExT will automatically register and compute your custom function. If `"all"` is in `feature_list`, your custom registered function will also be included in the computation.

# Load graphs with 70% of nodes
graph_collection = nxt.read_from_csv(
    edges_path="edges.csv",
    node_graph_mapping_path="node_graph_mapping.csv",
    node_sample_rate=0.7  # Use 70% of nodes
)
```

### Feature Importance Analysis

```python
# Compute feature importance
importance_df = nxt.compute_feature_importance(
    graph_collection=graph_collection,
    features=features,
    feature_importance_algorithm="supervised_fast",
    embedding_algorithm="approx_wasserstein"
)
```
